# README

## What is this?

This repo hosts my CF course RoR app. It is a portfolio piece, showcasing an ecommerce store for SEO products.

The app is hosted on Heroku at https://stivaroscfapp.herokuapp.com.

## Languages Used

This is predominantly a RoR app.

JavaScript and jQuery have been used for aspects of the front-end. CoffeeScript may be used if the code is refactored in future.

CSS (with some SASS) has been used for style, predominantly built upon Bootstrap.
